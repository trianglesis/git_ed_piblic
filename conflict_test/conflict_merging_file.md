3. Change this file in both branches
4. Push changes in your fork
5. Create Pull Request from each fork's branches into the original repository main branch
6. Merge first Pull Request after Review and aprroval

# Add here a few different lines:

1. Add some text at the branch test-ONE:
   1. But leave untouched another section 2.

Change this. Changing this at the branch ONE.

2. Add some test at the branch test-TWO:
   1. But leave untouched another section 1.

Change this: changing this at branch TWO, do not touch anything else. Push only from branch two!
